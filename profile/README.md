_Reach_ is an end-to-end encrypted communication platform designed for collaborative groups who wish
to let anonymous individuals reach out to them with information and/or requests. It is engineered
for the unique challenges posed by the needs of organisations and collectives that want to protect
themselves as much as the people who contact them.

## Development

Development happens in Codeberg, and this GitHub organisation only exists to host a few integrations.
